        <h2>The Belfry of Bruges</h2>

            <h3><a href="https://wowiwalkers.com/belfry-tower-of-bruges/">Belfry of Bruges</a></h3>
                <p>The Belfry of Bruges is a bell tower originally started in 1240, with 366 steps to the top that is open to the public to climb. Explore centuries old architecture, and you may be lucky enough to be there to hear the bell toll. A belfry can serve many purposes such as being home to the public archives, serve as a watch tower, or be the place to announce important events – which of all, the Belfry of Bruges did. The Belfort van Brugge used to be 102 meters tall with it a wooden spire on the top. However, in 1741, the spire went up in flames, and left the building standing at a 83-meters height, which it remains today. The entrance fee to the Belfry of Bruges varies depending on age and whether you have a Musea Brugge Card or not. </p>

                <p>The Basilica of the Holy Blood is a 12th century religious site, holding what is belived to be the blood of Jesus Christ on a cloth taken during Christ's crucifixion. It draws in faithful people and sceptics alike, and the blood is unveiled multiple times thoughout the day.On Ascension Day, a festival known as the Procession of the Holy Blood attracts residents and tourists alike. It is on this day that the Bishop of Bruges carries the cherished vial through the streets preceded by residents performing an historic reenactment of the relic’s arrival and acting out other biblical scenes. The first recorded procession took place in 1291, and some 718 years later, it is still happening.</p>
