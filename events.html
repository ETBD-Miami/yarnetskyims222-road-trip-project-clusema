            <h3><a href="https://bestbeerfestivals.com/bruges-beer-festival">Bruges Beer Festival</a></h3>
                <p>Every winter for the Bruges Beer Festival, taste a variety of beers, as well as enjoy concerts, games, and meet brewers who brewed the beer you drink! The Bruges Beer Festival features more than 280 beers from more than 70 breweries and eight top chefs cooking cuisine with beer.  It is held below the ancient Belfry, seen in the movie In Bruges, which is located on the main market square in old historic Bruges and in a large heated tent on the Grote markt (main square). This is one of the few, if not only, festivals in the world where all seven Belgian & Dutch Trappist beers are available, including the elusive Westvleteren.</p>
